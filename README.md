# Functional Factory Proof of Concept
The primary purpose of this project is to explore how functional factories would work in TypeScript.

In TypeScript, `types` can be used to describe the signature of a function the same way an interface can be used to describe the behavior of a class. Since TypeScript can be used to write pure functional code, and functions can return a type, then it's possible to write purely functional factories. That's what this project is intended to explore.
